discussions came from (in alphabetical order):

Jack O'Quin frequently acted as the primary maintainer of JACK for long
periods, and has contributed many new interfaces and bug fixes.

Stephane Letz ported JACK to OS X and wrote the new C++ SMP-aware
implementation [jackdmp](http://www.grame.fr/~letz/jackdmp.html). He and Johnny Petrantoni created
[JackOSX](http://jackosx.com/),
including JACK and utilities for OS X.
