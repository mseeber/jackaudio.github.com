        <h1>Routing GStreamer audio via JACK</h1>

<p>Its relatively easy to get audio from GStreamer to flow via JACK:</p>

<ol>
<li>You need the GStreamer JACK audio plugin, which is currently (Fall 2009) part of the &quot;bad&quot; plugins collection. Most Linux distributions make this available through their normal software install/update systems. The name of the package containing this plugin will vary from distribution to distribution: on Fedora its called &quot;gstreamer-plugins-bad-free-extra&quot;, on Ubuntu its called &quot;gst-plugins-bad&quot;, etc. etc. </li>
<li>Next, you need to configure GStreamer to tell it to use this plugin for audio output. There are 3 methods available: 

<ul>
<li>Through the command line using gconf2 (you may need to install this first) </li>
<li>Install/run gconf-editor, which is a general purpose utility for configuring many GNOME-centric applications </li>
<li>Some systems may have the gstreamer-properties command available, which offers a graphical tool for configuring gstreamer </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your goal is set the value of: 

<ul>
<li>/system/gstreamer/0.10/audio/default/musicaudiosink</li>
<li>/system/gstreamer/0.10/audio/default/audiosink</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>to this value: <code>jackaudiosink buffer-time=2000000</code>. The exact value of
<code>buffer-time</code> doesn&#39;t matter too much, but higher values reduce the chance of
glitches/drop-outs in the audio stream. You might also choose to set
/system/gstreamer/0.10/audio/default/chataudiosink to the same value, but its
less likely to be useful to you.</p>

<p>The impact of this will vary depending on how much your system uses GStreamer.
On modern GNOME-based systems, it will effectively divert all system sounds
and all audio playback via JACK. On other systems (e.g. KDE-based systems) it
will have less of an effect, though it will still impact specific applications
that use GStreamer.</p>
